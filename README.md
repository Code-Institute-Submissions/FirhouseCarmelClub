# Firehouse Football Club #

This project is developing for a real football club.
The original version of web site you could find by the following link http://www.firhousecarmel.com.
Firhouse Carmel Football Club was founded in 1974 to cater for Schoolboys and girls in the local area.
In this project you will find the new web site design for Club.

### UX ###

The main goal is help to find for  parents (site users / local community) information about  local football club for kids and youth.
On the other hand, the web sites owners will get more recognition and advertisement via
world wide web.

### Features ###

The web site consists from four conected with each other web pages.
The site developer could add new pages to this web site if necessary.
Page 1 is Home. from this section user could go to any sites sections or pages.
Page 2 is About, in this section the user will find information about club main aims and goals.
Page 3 is Contact, in the third section user will find all contact information such as phone number, email
and location map.
Page 4 Registration, in this section user will fill the registration form.
There is a extra link called Version 1.0 for visiting original web site.
Added Page 5 called Gallery with three fotos. 

### Testing ###

Project testing was carried out manually. 

Testing Home Page.

I begun testing from the first page of the project, Home. 
Most critical errors from this page was:

Sites Logo was located in the top-middle of page and had a big size, after that Logo had been moved to the left-top and minimized in size;

Logo was not displayed, fixed logo source link;

The same problem was with the background image source link, internal link was change to external link https://www.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/football-2518982_960_720.jpg and image started to display;

Menu toggle button worked incorrectly. When toggle button was pushed the main menu overlapped the image, 
the problem was fixed and now menu opens correctly and background image go down.

Testing page About.

Page main text was displayed too much to the left side, it was fixed by moving it to center.

Testing page Gallery.

Text inside the image was too small, fixed by increase of the text size.
Side arrows inside image was too small, fixed by increase of the arrows size.

Particular attention during development and testing was given to the mobile version of the site so that all elements do not go over each other or behind the screen.


### Technologies Used ###

To complete this project the site developer uses HTML, CSS languages and framework BOOTSTRAP.
The project was developed and tested in Gitpod IDE and transferred from Gitpod to Github external repository:
https://github.com/aleksandrsg/FirhouseF.C.

Project css file was minified. To minify css file I have used online resource:

You could see the favicon in the page title. To do favicon.ico file I used:

Thank you and enjoy!
